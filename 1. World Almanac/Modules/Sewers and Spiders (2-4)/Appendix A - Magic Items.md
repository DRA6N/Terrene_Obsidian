# Appendix A: Magic Items
Below are magic items found within the adventure:

## Cape of the Mountebank

^ff09cb

##### Rare, Conjuration
![[Cape of the Mountebank.png]]
This cape smells faintly of brimstone. While wearing it, you can use it to cast the Dimension Door spell as an action. This property of the cape can't be used again until the next dawn.

When you disappear, you leave behind a cloud of smoke, and you appear in a similar cloud of smoke at your destination. The smoke lightly obscures the space you left and the space you appear in, and it dissipates at the end of your next turn. A light or stronger wind disperses the smoke. 

## Cerulean Missive

##### Uncommon, Abjuration

The cerulean missive is a deep blue envelope with a circular, black, wax seal bearing a deep red insignia in the shape of a raindrop. 

The cerulean missive is sealed with a modification of the spell *arcane lock.* The letter cannot be opened unless the spell is dispelled. The spell can be dispelled by a drop of humanoid blood placed on the seal.

## Pipes of Haunting

##### *Uncommon, Necromancy*
![[Pipes of Haunting.png]]
You must be proficient with wind instruments or in the *Performance* skill to use these pipes. They have 3 charges. You can use an action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, 
spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you that hears you must succeed on a **DC 15 Wisdom** saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the area that aren't hostile toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat it at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. <br>The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. 
## RoseWood Mirror

##### Uncommon, Divination
![[RoseWood Mirror.png]]
The rosewood mirror is a palm sized sheet of glass set in a frame of dark wood that reveals the truth of creatures reflected in it. Any creature hidden by an illusion is displayed in its true form. Any invisible creature or creature in the Ethereal Plane can be seen. Any shapechanger appears in its original form. 
## Security Gem

^65b388

##### Uncommon, Abjuration (requires attunement)
![[Security Gem.png]]
The security gem is a palm-sized black opal. This item has 1d4 +1 charges. When a creature attuned to this gem fails a saving throw, they can expend a charge to succeed instead. Once this item has zero charges, the opal transforms into a worthless chip of black glass.
