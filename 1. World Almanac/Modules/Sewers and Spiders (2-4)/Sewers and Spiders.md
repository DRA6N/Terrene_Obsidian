## Important NPCs
##### **Thandion Reeves** - "Gentleman" Thief
![[Thandion Reeves.png|lp center| 500]]
*Neutral Evil - Half-Orc*

Every city has a dark side. For as long as people have been coming together to build civilization, some have chosen the path of professional criminality. Thandion Reeves is one such person. Thandion made his name among the criminal element of Underdale with a thieves' guild known as the *Heel of the Snake.* 
Thandion Reeves kicks off this adventure by stealing the **Cerulean Missive.**

##### Lady Akunai - Cold-Blooded Aristocrat
*Neutral Evil - High Elf*

Some people were just made to have wealth; Lady Akunai has made it her buisness to become one of those people. Coming up through the cutthroat business world of Underdale left Lady Akunai sharp as a dagger. Golden opportunities await those who impress her.

At all times, Lady Akunai is attended by her manservant and bodyguard - a **wight** named Lo'aztani.

The **Cerulean Missive** was sent to Lady Akunai who expects to receive it promptly.

##### Elsin Orsen - Missive Messenger
*True Neuutral - Human*

Elsin Orsen is a 14-year-old girl with a mess of curly red hair spilling out from underneath a flat cap and a constellation of freckles across her nose. She makes money as a city-to-city boat messenger to support herself and her ailing brother. She's from out of town and was paid triple her usual rate to bring the Cerulean Missive into Underdale. So, she rented a boat and sailed out, planning to travel back to her hometown in as little as a few weeks.

## Plot Hooks
The adventure begins when the party meets Elsin Orsen who has been violently dispossessed of the Cerulean Missive.
##### Use one of the following three plot hooks to introduce the plot:
###### For Glory
While the party travels through the streets of Underdale, they stumble upon the dazed human messenger Elsin Orsen. Elsin checks her pockets and realizes that the missive is missing. She remembers being accosted by a half-orc with a shock of white hair and mutton chops. Elsin fears Lady Akunai and begs the party to help her recover the missive, promising 50gp. "I'm staying at the Candlekeeper's Claw. Please, if you can, get that letter back to me. It could, quite literally, save my life!"

###### For Riches
A horse-drawn palanquin cuts across the road in front of the party, stopping them in their tracks as they travel through the streets of Underdale. A voice, not quite human, speaks from within the curtains.
"We mean you no harm."
A pouch full of coins (50gp) is thrown at their feet. The carriage comes to a stop not far from the alleyway where Elsin Orsen is recovering from unconsciousness.

Lady Akunai will not identify herself during this conversation, referring to herself, if pressed, as "an interested party."

###### For Business
The party are the beleaguered owners and only employees of a failing Detective Agency/ Adventuring group operating out of Underdale. They have tin minutes to choose a name and figure out what their last gig was. If they don't start earning money fast, the business will have to shut down , and they'll all be out on the street. 

Luckily for them, a young girl stumbles through the front door, clutching her head,which has only just stopped bleeding. It's Elsin Orsen - your next case.

## Tracking Thandion
**Elsin's Story.** She was cutting through the alleyway when she was accosted by a half-orc with a shock of white hair and mutton chops. She has no idea who he was, but she did notice the insignia of a snake wrapped around a boot on his shoulder. A ***DC 12 Intelligence (History)*** check is enough to remember some details about the Heel of the Snake.

After hearing Elsin's story, a dungeon master can choose one or more of the following three NPCs to direct the party towards the sewers.

***Kimbatuul, the old druid***
As the party chats with Elsin, an elderly woman peers out through the shutters in the second story of her home. She was watching when Thandion attacked Elsin and knows that he's escaped into the sewers. Thandion has been a menace in this neighborhood for months now, and Kimbatuul has been looking for some heroes to help her conduct a citizen's arrest. 

Kimbatuul is the leader of the **Order of Honor**, a neighborhood watch association composed of concerned citizens which fights whatever crime the city guard are too afraid or busy to. When Kimbatuul first started the Order of Honor, more than twenty years ago, she was an accomplished warrior and crafty tactician. Over the years, her body has begun to betray her and the Order's membership dwindled. Now, only she carries the banner ,and she only fights in spirit. 

Kimbatuul is looking for new hearoes to take up her name and start a second generation of heroes to work for the people of Underdale. She asks the party to bring Thandion back to her, alive. If they do, she inducts them as knights into the Order of Honor. 

***Following the tree eyed cat***
A fiendish three eyed cat sits on a nearby wall and stares at the party until it has their attention. It leads the party back to the home of Ungren Lomm, an arcanaloth who is disguised as a wizened human archmage. Ungren can tell the party where Thandion has gone in exchange for a memory from each of them. A powerful memory, something meaningful. Something that hurts. In addition, Ungren asks that the party bring any magical items they find to him so he can add them to his collection.

***The Slimy Informant***
Weyo Oppalon is a lizardfold with salamander-like characteristics, including shiny, dewy skin that she must keep damp at all times. She used to be a member of the Heel of the Snake but now acts as a double agent, giving a heads up to the authorities about some of the gang's activities. Weyo knows that the Heel of the Snake likes to move through the sewers but is reticent to offer information.

Weyo can be found on the second floor of the Candlekeeper's Cove, a local inn known for its criminal clientele. A ***DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion)*** check can change her mind, however. THis check can be made with advantage if your party either bribes her with more than 50gp or promises to keep her safe.

On a failure, Weyo Oppalon is spooked and attempts to flee. She makes a break for a nearby window and uses her **Slippers of Spider Climbing** to take to the rooftops. Should the party follow, use the Chase Rules in Chapter 8 of the **Dungeaon Master's Guide**. After 5 rounds, the chase brings the party to the mouth of a sewer grate. Weyo slips through easily, and later can be found struggling in a web in the Cobweb Junction.

## Into the Sewers
![[Sewers and Spiders Map.jpg]]
Sewers - Details
- No lighting unless otherwise specified
- Ceilings are about 8 feet, enough for a medium creature to stand comfortably

# 1. The Web Woven Hall
```ad-ReadAloud
As the party steps into the sewers, splashing their boots in the city's muck, the dim light filtering in from above disappears, leaving total darkness in its stead. The pained screams of a young man echo off the stonework from deeper inside. A matrix of thick spiderwebs close off the hallway.
```

***Through the Spider's Web***. Any character who touches the web must succeed on a **DC 12 Strength** check to free themselves. A character who fails this check becomes restrained and must make subsequent checks with disadvantage.

The webs are flammable and can be ignited by torch or by dealing at least 8 fire damage.

***The Spider's Last Meal.*** The Body of the spider's last victim hangs in the web near the ceiling and falls if the web is destroyed. The skin is blueish-purple. The face is unrecognizable, though, the body wears commoner's clothes. The body is squishy to the touch and in awful condition. Any creature that wants to approach the body to loot it must succeed on a **DC 12 Wisdom** saving throw or be frightened of the body for ten minutes. This corpse holds 3gp, 15sp, a dose of antivenom, and a vial of Alchemist's Fire. 

# 2. Sewage Circle
```ad-ReadAloud
Dim light streams into this room from an open grate in the ceiling. An inch of foul sewage covers the floor. Three hallways branch out from this room. Another scream echoes from deeper in the sewers.
```

***Thandion's Screams.*** A **DC 16 Wisdom (Perception)** check can tell which hallway to follow or get closer to Thandion.

***Rats' Respite.*** This room is a crossroads for the **giant rats** that live in the sewer. A **DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation)** check in this room will turn up some rat droppings underneath the water that indicate they travel through here.

Should the party leave this room and return to it. 5 (2d4) [[Appendix C - Statblocks#^Giant-Rat|Giant Rat]] splash through the water and attack. 

# 3. The Dead End
```ad-ReadAloud
The path snakes down 50 feet before ending in a grate that vents into the mud. A clutch of light blue and white eggs are buried in the mud.
```

***Phase Spider Eggs.*** 10 (4d4) light blue eggs sit in the mud. If a creature touches any of the eggs, there is a 50% chance that the egg will disappear.

# 4. The Cube and the Chest
```ad-ReadAloud
The floor is surprisingly clean in this corridor. A wooden chest with a shiny brass latch sits against the far wall.
```

***The Cube.*** A [[Appendix C - Statblocks#^ff1a8c|Gelatinous Cube]] wobbles maliciously between the party and the chest.

***Treasure.*** The chest is unlocked. Inside is a **Potion of Healing,** a potion of antivenom, a crowbar, and a rusted key that acts as a **Scroll of Knock**, disintegrating after being used. 

# 5. The Middle Path
```ad-ReadAloud
The middle path leads deeper into the sewer sloping downward. Another patch of graying webs obstructs this hallway.
```

***Narrow Hallway.*** This hall is only five feet wide. A party will have to walk through single file

***A Glimpse Ahead.*** If the party member at the head of the line has a Passive Perception above 12, they catch a glimpse of the phase spider in the next room.

***Rats Attack!*** If the party hasn't already encountered giant rats in the sewer circle, 2 (1d4) giant rats attack from behind. The narrow confines allow them only to nip at the rearmost party member. 

# 6. Cobweb Junction
```ad-ReadAloud
The narrow tunel hallway opens into an expansive room with ceilings vaulted almost fifty feet high. On the outher side of the room, there is a raised platform, ten feet off the ground with ladders on either side. Metal grates set in the floor show a flowing river of filth beneath. A five-foot section of grating has been torn open by something large.
```

***River of Filth.*** Any creature that jumps in the river is whisked away toward the Spider's Lair and must make a **DC 16 Constitution** saving throw at the start of each turn, suffering 3 (1d6) poison damage on a failure and half as much on a success. The trip to the spider's lair takes ten turns.

***On the Platform.*** A valve wheel sits on the platform. Turning the wheel opens the door to the east. A note affixed to the wheel is impossible to read without light. It says, "Remember to turn the Flow Control Wheel and the Stopgap wheel at the same time. I know it's a pain, but we don't want a repeat of last time."

***Phase Spider.*** The [[Appendix C - Statblocks#^db2247|Phase Spider]] lurks in this room and lairs here. If the party makes no attempt to move stealthily, the phase spider hears their approach as they move through the middle path and shifts into the ethereal plane. From here, it launches its attack.

If the party are 3rd level or higher, consider giving the phase spider maximum (55) hit points.

```ad-note
## Weakening the Phase Spider:
During an early playtest of this adventure with a 2nd level party, the phase spider popped into existence in front of our barbarian and downed them with one bite - and that was our team's tank! A dramatic moment, for sure, but not necessarily a fun one for that player. Part of the fun of a phase spider's hunting pattern is its ability to slowly whittle down its prey. If your party are second level or lower, consider dropping the phase spider's poison damage to 9 (2d8) poison damage. Still enough to one-shot your unlucky sorcerer while giving a fighter enough space to still feel powerful.
```

# 7. Flow Control Wheel
```ad-ReadAloud
An old and rusted wheel protrudes from the wall, surrounded by a maze of old piping. At the foot of the wheel is the corpse of a dwarven sewer worker.
```

***Dwarf Corpse.*** A **DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine)** check reveals this poor dwarf has been the victim of hundreds of tiny spider bites rather than one big one. A **DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation)** check or thorough check of the dwarf's pockets reveals a bone white flute carved with an engraving in the shape of a dragon. This flute functions as [[Appendix A - Magic Items#^fa06f6|Pipes of Haunting]].

***Turning the Wheel.*** Despite the rust, the wheel turns easily. Dozens of tiny spiders that had been nesting inside pour out of the axle. A [[Appendix C - Statblocks#^1325ae|Swarm of Insects]] appear in the same space as the creature turning the wheel. Turning this wheel redirects the flow of sewage so that the party can travel to the Spider's Lair unhindered.

# 8. Serpent's Slumber
```ad-ReadAloud
A Giant Constrictor snake sleeps in the muck. This creature is so large, that curled around three times on top of itself, it comes to a height of five feet. Bright red stripes show against its otherwise dun colored scales.
```

***The Sleeping Snake.*** The snake that slumbers here is a [[Appendix C - Statblocks#^27a9ad|Fire-Breathing Giant Constrictor Snake]] named **Esganabi.** This beast has amassed a fortune over the years, which it keeps in a treasure chest.

***Accessing the chest.*** A **DC 11 group Dexterity (Stealth)** check is enough for the party to pass through the room without waking the snake. However, if anyone would like to approach the chest, they must succeed on a **DC 16 Dexterity Stealth** check. On a failure, the snake begins to stir but does not yet wake up - the creature attempting the stealth check is not yet detected but is unable to access the treasure chest. After three failures, the snake awakens.

***The Serpent Speaks.*** The snake speaks Draconic and, if awoken, is not shy about making its displeasure known. Esganabi's chiefest delight is treasure. The snake offers to let the party pass unharmed in exchange for something of worth.

Although Esganabi is very powerful, it is also very lazy, hoping to avoid exerting themselves. In combat, Esganabi prefers to use its crushing weight rather than its fire breath to subdue its enemies.

***Treasure.*** Inside the snake's treasure chest there is a +1 whip with a handle made of basilisk scale, 66gp, 120sp, a lion's head carved from obsidian, a vial of antivenom, a scroll of *Invisibility*, a [[Appendix A - Magic Items#^dd1ae7|RoseWood Mirror]], and a tiny statue of a sparrow carved of quartz.  

# 9. Fetid Gap
```ad-ReadAloud
As the hallway continues, the stone floor is replaced by metal grating over a gurgling river of sewage. The smell floating up through the holse is nauseating. A fifteen-foot stretch of the grating has broken away, leaving only a gap over bubbling, flowing dook. 
```

***Jumping the Gap.*** Any creature with a strength score of 15 or higher can automatically make the leap. A creature with a lower strength must succeed on a **DC 13 Strength (Athletics)** check to leap across the gap. 

***Into the Muck.*** A creature that falls into the muck takes 3 (1d6) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The walls are smoothed by years of erosion, climbing out without assistance requires a **DC 20 Strength (Athletics)** check. With the aid of a rope, the DC is lowered to 10.

***One Man's Trash.*** A creature in the river with a passive Perception greater than 10 notices a strip of bright red fabric. A [[Appendix A - Magic Items#^ff09cb|Cape of the Mountebank]] floats among the mire. A **DC 12 Strength** check by a creature in the muck is required to get the cape.

# 10. Stopgap Wheel
Turning this wheel stops the flow of water from east to west through the cobweb junction.

***Ethereal Webbing.*** This wheel is surrounded by webs that, like the spider, exist half in the ethereal plane. A creature with a **Passive Perception** above 14 is able to duck in time as a web flickers into being.

***The Rusted Wheel.*** This wheel is rusted, requiring an action to turn. To successfully turn the wheel, a creature must succeed on a **DC 12 Strength** check. This check must be made three times to fully stop the flow of water. A creature that fails this check can try again at no cost. 

# 11. The Veil of Darkness
```ad-ReadAloud
The hallway seems to end abruptly, with sharp edges that disappear into nothingness. Light does not penetrate the darkness. You all watch as a sewer rat scuttling by sprints into the gloom and disappears from sight.
```

***A Sweet Voice.*** The first party member that steps into the darkness hears a dark, sibilant voice. "Step closer, young one. Inherit the blessing of our web."

***Refusing the Call.*** Should the character that walks into the magical darkness back out into the hallway, the call is offered only once more to the next creature that enters. The third and all other creatures that enter the darkness run into a stone wall.

***Accepting the Blessing.*** A creature who steps into the darkness must make a **DC 12 Charisma*** saving throw. Regardless of the result, that creature is transformed into a **drider**. Their upper body remains the same, but everything below the waist is replaced with the abdomen of a giant spider. A character that fails the saving throw has their alignment become Lawful Evil. The creature must attempt the same saving throw again after each long rest. 

The player character maintains their class levels and abilities, and those granted by their ancestry. In addition, they gain the following traits and actions:

- ***Hit Points.*** The drider has 52 (8d10 + 8) hit points
- ***Spider Climb.*** The drider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
- ***The Hunger.*** The drider must eat a medium or larger creature, in full, once every 24 hours. If the drider fails to do so, it must succeed on a **DC 20 Constitution** saving throw or suffer one level of exhausting due to hunger. 
- ***Web Spinner.*** The drider can spend a minute spinning a ten foot by ten foot section of spiderwebs. A creature that touches the web is restrained and can use its action to attempt a Strength check with a DC equal to 8 + *the drider's constitution modifier + the drider's proficiency Bonus.*
- ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target, 2 (1d4) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) poison damage.

# 12. The Spider's Lair

The spider's lair is all sharp shale shelves and stalagmites. Dreary gray rock, and cold dripping water. Every sound echoes. Cobwebs full of long-dead corpses litter the area. The only way into the Spider's Lair is via the passage from the Cobweb Junction after turning off the flow of the sewage.

***Dark Magic.*** A dark and cruel magic keeps this lair unlit. All open flames are automatically quenched. On initiative count 20 of each round, any creature using magic to create light must succeed on a **DC 12 Charisma** saving throw, or that light is dispelled. 

***Thandion.*** Thandion is suspended upside-down in a spider web. Thandion begs the party to free him, offering to help fight the giant spider.

Thandion uses the statistics of a [[Appendix C - Statblocks#^89029f|Thug]].

Freeing Thandion from the spider web requires a minute of work, hacking away at the thick webbing. A minute after the party enters this room, if it hasn't already been defeated, the spider appears. 

Once he believes the phase spider is no longer a problem, Thandion will attempt to escape, turning on any weakened party members who try to stop him. 

***Treasure.*** The [[Appendix A - Magic Items#^e29cfe|Cerulean Missive]] and a [[Appendix A - Magic Items#^65b388|Security Gem]] both lay on the floor beneath Thandion, having fallen out of his pockets. The security gem has 2 (1d4) charges left. 

### Text of the Cerulean Missive
```ad-note
In payment for your contributions to the White Oak INstitute we have left a gift for you in the sewers of your city: a beast native to the world that I live in with the power to move quickly between my world and yours. The Web continues to grow more powerful with each new connection made. Needless to say, your membership has been accepted.
- P.
```

***A Sinister Voice.*** When the party vanquishes the phase spider, or escapes the room with Thandion in tow, a dark feminine voice laughs. She says, "Worry not, my little flies. One day, you'll all end up in my web."


<hr>

## Meeting Lady Akunai
Elsin Orsen waits for the party in the Candlekeeper's Claw. If they return with the cerulean missive, she asks them to come with her to Lady Akunai's chateau.

Upon hearing the story, Lady Akunai rewards the party with 100gp each and promises a future relationship.

Just as the party turns to leave, Lady Akunai calls out, "Elsin, please stay a while. We have much to discuss."
