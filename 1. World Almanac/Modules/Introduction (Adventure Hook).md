## Adventure Background
``` ad-ReadAloud
Tired of your monotonous lives, whether it be farming, working in the stables, selling yourselves out as mercenaries, or laboring as blacksmiths, you and your group of young companions yearn for the thrill of adventure. Craving a taste of the unknown, you decide to see the world and make some coin along the way.

During your travels, fate brings you together on a ship bound for Underdale, the major trade city just south of the Utorim mainland. Each of you, seeking a break from the routine, shares stories and dreams during the voyage. As the ship plows through the open waters, the camaraderie among you grows, and a decision is made to band together upon arriving in Underdale.

With the last of your coins spent on the journey, you arrive in the bustling city with dreams of excitement and opportunity. Eager to gather rumors of adventure, you and your newfound companions head to the most popular tavern in Underdale. Laughter and the clinking of mugs surround you as you enter, a lively atmosphere that fuels your anticipation for the unknown adventures awaiting you in this vibrant trade city.

Near the entrance, a bulletin board catches your collective eye. Pinned with various job postings, the worn and tattered papers speak of past adventurers who sought glory before you. Yet, a couple of notices remain in readable condition, promising potential adventures, coin, and a chance to break free from the monotony left behind. United by your shared journey and the tales exchanged on the ship, you stand ready to embrace the challenges and excitement that Underdale has to offer.

```ad-ReadAloud
The Frozen Griffon, a beacon of familiarity in your wanderings, mirrors the essence of countless taverns along your travels. The heart of the establishment is marked by a generous hearth against the far wall, its flickering flames casting a warm and inviting glow. Along the left wall, an aged bar top, adorned with scattered wooden stools, stands as a testament to the stories shared and spirits lifted.

Amidst the main room's tapestry of conversations, a handful of patrons find solace or celebration at tables, their tales echoing against the backdrop of ale-filled mugs. A minstrel, perched on a bar stool near the hearth, gently coaxes soothing melodies from her lute, adding a musical layer to the symphony of camaraderie.

The Frozen Griffon's fame echoes through the land of Utorim. Countless adventurers, their tales etched in the timber of this renowned tavern, have cut their teeth within these walls. Here, amidst the familiar embrace of hearth and ale, the legacy of seasoned wanderers intertwines with the stories of those yet to embark on their own journeys.
