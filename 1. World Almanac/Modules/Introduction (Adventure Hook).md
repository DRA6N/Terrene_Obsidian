## Adventure Background

The characters are tired of their monotonous way of life, whether it be farming, working in the stables, selling themselves out as mercenaries, or working as a blacksmith. Maybe they are young, and haven't had a taste of that adventurer's life yet. They decide they want to see the world, and make some coin while doing so.

During their travels, they hear about the major trade city just south of the Utorim mainland, Underdale, and decide that would be a good place to seek out adventure. The players spent the last of their coin getting to Underdale.

After spending some time in Underdale, the characters sought out the employment guild (or see **Alternate Hook Below**). Inside the guild, there is a bulletin board with some job postings. Some of the papers are tattered and illegible, but there are a couple still in readable condition.

>Underdale is a large costal city located just beyond the southernmost tip of Utorim.

##### The Three legible postings are:
- [[A Most Potent Brew]]
- Cargo Escort
- Carnival of Carnage

##### An alternate Hook:
- [[Sewers and Spiders]]


They find a particular posting by a man named Dimitri Valkenweave, the only information is that it is an escort mission to escort cargo. The posting instructs the players to meet at the Frozen Griffon, a local tavern, at sunset on 12 Firewane - which just so happens to be today.

### The Frozen Griffon![[Frozen Griffon.jpg]]
```ad-ReadAloud
The Frozen Griffon, a beacon of familiarity in your wanderings, mirrors the essence of countless taverns along your travels. The heart of the establishment is marked by a generous hearth against the far wall, its flickering flames casting a warm and inviting glow. Along the left wall, an aged bar top, adorned with scattered wooden stools, stands as a testament to the stories shared and spirits lifted.

Amidst the main room's tapestry of conversations, a handful of patrons find solace or celebration at tables, their tales echoing against the backdrop of ale-filled mugs. A minstrel, perched on a bar stool near the hearth, gently coaxes soothing melodies from her lute, adding a musical layer to the symphony of camaraderie.

The Frozen Griffon's fame echoes through the land of Utorim. Countless adventurers, their tales etched in the timber of this renowned tavern, have cut their teeth within these walls. Here, amidst the familiar embrace of hearth and ale, the legacy of seasoned wanderers intertwines with the stories of those yet to embark on their own journeys.
