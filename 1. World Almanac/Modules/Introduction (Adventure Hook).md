## Adventure Background

The characters are tired of their monotonous way of life, whether it be farming, working in the stables, selling themselves out as mercenaries, or working as a blacksmith. Maybe they are young, and haven't had a taste of that adventurer's life yet. They decide they want to see the world, and make some coin while doing so.

They hear about the major trade city just south of the Utorim mainland, Port Gisahl, and decide that would be a good place to seek out adventure. The players spent the last of their coin getting to Port Gisahl.

After spending some time in Port Gisahl, the characters  sought out the employment guild (or see **Alternate Hook Below**). Inside the guild there is a bulletin board with some job postings. Some of the papers are tattered and illegible, but there are a couple still in readable condition.

##### The Three legible postings are:
- [[A Most Potent Brew]]
- Cargo Escort
- Carnival of Carnage

##### An alternate Hook:
- [[Sewers and Spiders]]


They find a particular posting by a man named Dimitri Valkenweave, the only information is that it is an escort mission to escort cargo. The posting instructs the players to meet at the Frozen Griffon, a local tavern, at sunset on 12 Firewane - which just so happens to be today.

### The Frozen Griffon![[Frozen Griffon.jpg]]
```ad-ReadAloud
The Frozen Griffon resembles that of any other tavern you've come across in your travels. A large hearth against the far wall cracles and gives off a warm and inviting glow. Along the far left wall is an aged bar top, with some wooden stools stewn around it.

A handful of patrons sit at tables across the main room of the tavern, lost in conversation or drowning their sorrows in a pint of ale. A minstrel sits on a bar stool near the hearth, strumming away gently on her lute.
