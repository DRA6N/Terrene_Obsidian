## Azuth

![[Azuth_symbol.png|lp left|200]]Azuth, the Lord of Spells, was a lesser deity who concerned himself with the advancement and preservation of the magical arts. Worshiped by all manner of spellcasters (and wizards in particular), the crafty deity acted as an adviser to the sitting deity of raw magic; he and Mystra shared an amicable relationship akin to that of tutor and favorite student. Other deities found him crotchety, not understanding his dry wit or ceaseless dedication to collecting magical knowledge. Azuth most often appeared as a white-bearded man wearing elaborate, antique clothing and wielding the powerful, gem-topped Old Staff.

>Reason is the best way to approach magic, and magic can be examined and reduced to its component parts through study and meditation. Maintain calm and use caution in your spellcasting and magic use to avoid making mistakes that even magic cannot undo. Use the art wisely, and always be mindful of when it is best not to use magic. Teach the wielding of magic and dispense learning throughout Terrene that the use and knowledge of magic may spread. Live and teach the idea that with magical power comes grave responsibility. Learn every new spell you discover and make a copy for the temple library. Do not hoard your knowledge, and encourage creativity in magic in all ways and at all times.

## Bane
![[bane.png|lp right|250]]Bane, The Black Lord, is the evil and malicious greater deity of fear, hatred and tyranny. Preferring to plot and scheme, Bane rarely appears to act in a direct manner; instead acting through his worshipers and other various agents. His ultimate goal is to eventually control all of Terrene. When summoned, he has a dark and rather shadowy appearance, with a resemblance of dark armor and his tell-tale jeweled dark gauntlet. He emanates an aura of vast power and cruel intelligence.

>Serve no one but Bane. Fear him always and make others fear him even more than you do. The Black Hand always strikes down those who stand against it in the end. Defy Bane and die – or in death find loyalty to him, for he shall compel it. Submit to the word of Bane as uttered by his ranking clergy, since true power can only be gained through service to him. Spread the dark fear of Bane. It is the doom of those who do not follow him to let power slip through their hands. Those who cross the Black Hand meet their dooms earlier and more harshly than those who worship other deities.

## Chauntea
![[chauntea.png|lp left|220]]Chauntea , the Grain Goddess or the Great Mother, is the goddess of life and a parallel deity to Silvanus, who is considered the god of wild nature, whilst Chauntea herself is seen as being the embodiment of all things agrarian or agriculture. She is a goddess of agriculture, plants cultivated by humans, farmers, gardeners, and summer.

>Some of her worshipers claimed that her divine glimmer gave life to the natural world, and some contended that she was the creator and source of all mortal races. In some sense Chauntea was the manifestation of the earth itself

>\-the Avatar of the worlds Toril.
## Cyric
![[cyric.png|lp right|250]]Cyric , whose titles included The Lord of Three Crowns, The Mad God, and The Prince of Lies was the monomaniacal deity of strife and lies with an immense following, though after he murdered Mystra and caused the Spellplague, his faith diminished somewhat. He was petty and self-centered, and enjoyed misleading individuals of all inclinations so that they performed acts that ruined their lives or so that they made fatal mistakes. Cyric was closely associated with the essence of murder, conflict, lies, intrigue, and illusions. Cyric was recognized in Terrene by his symbol, a white jawless skull on a black or purple sunburst, and his alignment was chaotic evil. He was a greater power, who ruled supreme in his divine realm.

## Helm
![[helm.png|lp left|200]]Helm also known as the Vigilant One and The Watcher, is the god of guardians, protection and protectors. He is worshiped by guards and paladins both, long being seen as a cold and focused deity who impartially took the role of defender and sometimes also enforcer.

## Ilmater
![[ilmater.png|lp right|220]]Ilmater was an intermediate deity of the Terrene pantheon whose portfolio included endurance, martyrdom, perseverance, and suffering. He was the god of those who suffered, the oppressed, and the persecuted, who offered them relief and support, encouraged them to endure, and who encouraged others to help them, to take their burdens or take their places. He was called the Crying God, the Broken God, the Lord on the Rack, and the One Who Endures.

## Kelemvor
![[kelemvor.png|lp left|250]]Kelemvor (pronounced KELL-em-vor), formerly Kelemvor Lyonsbane, also known as the Lord of the Dead and Judge of the Damned, was the god of death and the dead. In his mortal days, Kelemvor was a skilled mercenary, with the heart of a noble paladin.

Kelemvor urges knowledge that death is a natural part of life and should not be feared as long as it is understood.

## Lathander
![[lathander.png|lp right|250]]Lathander, The Morninglord, is worshiped as a deity of creativity, dawn, renewal, birth, athletics, spring, self-perfection, vitality and youth. He favors those who dispell the undead and blesses those who plant new life. Lathander is also the god called upon to bless birth and fertility related ceremonies.

>Strive always to aid, to foster new hope, new ideas, and new prosperity for all humankind and its allies. Perfect thyself, and guard ever against pride, for it is a sacred duty to foster new growth, nurture growing things, and work for rebirth and renewal. Be fertile in mind and in body. Consider always the consequences of thine actions so that the least effort may bring the greatest and best reward. Wherever you go, sow seeds of plants, tend the growing things you find, and plant seeds of hope, new ideas, and plans for a rosy future in the minds of all. Whenever possible, see each dawn.

## Mystra
![[mystra.png|lp left|250]]Mystra (pronounced MISS-trah), the Mother of all Magic, formerly known as Midnight, is a greater goddess who guides the magic that envelopes Terrene and its surrounding space. Mystra tends to the Weave constantly, making possible all the miracles and mysteries wrought by magic and users of magic.

Mystra is said to be a manifestation of the Cosmic Balance—maintaining order in the world of magic by correcting great inequalities if things went askew.

## Oghma
![[oghhma.png|lp right|250]]Oghma (pronounced OGG-mah), also known as The Lord of Knowledge, was the neutral greater power of bards, inspiration, invention, and knowledge in Terrene. Those who worship Oghma include artists, bards, cartographers, inventors, loremasters, sages, scholars, scribes and wizards.

>Knowledge, particularly the raw knowledge of ideas, is supreme. An idea has no weight, but it can move mountains. The greatest gift of humankind, an idea outweighs anything made by mortal hands. Knowledge is power and must be used with care, but hiding it away from others is never a good thing. Stifle no new ideas, no matter how false and crazed they seem; rather, let them be heard and considered. Never slay a singer, nor stand by as others do so. Spread knowledge wherever it is prudent to do so. Curb and deny falsehoods, rumor, and deceitful tales whenever you encounter them. Write or copy lore of great value at least once a year and give it away. Sponsor and teach bards, scribes, and record keepers. Spread truth and knowledge so that all folk know more. Never deliver a message falsely or incompletely. Teach reading and writing to those who ask (if your time permits), and charge no fee for the teaching.

## Selune
![[slune.png|lp left|250]]Selûne (pronounced seh-LOON-ay), also known as Our Lady of Silver and the Moonmaiden, was the goddess of the moon. She was also venerated in Terrene as a goddess of light, stars, navigation, navigators, wanderers, questers, and goodly lycanthropes.

>Let all on whom Selûne’s light falls be welcome if they desire. As the silver moon waxes and wanes, so too does life. Trust in Selûne’s radiance, and know that all love alive under her light shall know her blessing. Turn to the moon, and she will be your true guide. Promote acceptance and tolerance. See all other beings as equals. Aid fellow Selûnites as if they were your dearest friends.
>
>\- Dogma of Selune

## Shar
![[shar.png|lp right|250]]Shar, the Mistress of the Night, is the goddess of darkness, and the caverns of Terrene, as well as a neutral evil greater deity. Counterpart to her twin Selûne, she presided over caverns, darkness, dungeons, forgetfulness, loss, night, secrets, and the Underdark. Among her array of twisted powers was the ability to see everything that lay or happened in the dark.

>Reveal secrets only to fellow members of the faithful. Never follow hope or turn to promises of success. Quench the light of the moon (agents and items of Selûne) whenever you find it, and hide from it when you cannot prevail. The dark is a time to act, not wait. It is forbidden to strive to better your lot in life or to plan ahead save when directly overseen by the faithful of the Dark Deity. Consorting with the faithful of good deities is a sin except in business dealings or to corrupt them from their beliefs. Obey and never speak out against ranking clergy unless it would result in your own death.

## Silvanus
![[silvanus.png|lp left|220]]Silvanus, the Forest Father, was the god of nature, though formerly considered only the god of wild nature and druids. Silvanus was one of the oldest and most prominent deities in Terrene, and the wilder counterpart to Chauntea the Earthmother. His worshipers protected places of nature from the encroachment of civilization with vigor and were implacable foes of industrious peoples.

>Silvanus saw and balanced all, meting out wild water and drought, fire, and ice, life and death. Hold your distance and take in the total situation, rather than latching on to the popular idea of what is best. All is in cycle, deftly and beautifully balanced. It is the duty of the devout to see this cycle and the sacred Balance as clearly as possible. Make others see the Balance and work against those that would disturb it. Watch, anticipate, and quietly manipulate. Resort to violence and open confrontation only when pressured by time or hostile action. Fight against the felling of forests, banish disease wherever you find it, defend the trees, and plant new flora wherever possible. Seek out, serve, and befriend the dryads and learn their names. Kill only when needful, destroy fire and its employers, and beware orcs and others who bring axes into the forest.

>\-Dogma of Silvanus

## Sune
![[sune.png|lp right|250]]Sune, also known as Lady Firehair, is the deity of beauty, with governance also over love. Her dogma primarily concerns love based on outward beauty, with primary importance placed upon loving people who respond to the Sunite’s appearance.

>Beauty is more than skin deep. It issues from the core of one’s being and reveals one’s true face to the world, fair or foul. Believe in romance, as true love will win over all. Follow your heart to your true destination. Love none more than yourself except Sune, and lose yourself in love of the Lady Firehair. Perform a loving act each day, and seek to awaken love in others. Respond to love at least once in a day. Encourage beauty wherever you find it. Acquire beautiful items of all sorts, and encourage, sponsor, and protect those who create them. Keep your own body as comely as possible and as attractively displayed as situations warrant. Let hairstyle and clothing best suit your personal appearance, striving to stir and delight others who look upon you. Moreover, hide not away, but always seek to present yourself to those around you in a pleasing variety of garbs and activities so as to move them with love and desire. Love those who respond to your appearance, and let warm friendship and admiration flower where love cannot or dares not.

## Talos
![[talos.png|lp right]]Talos, also known as The Storm Lord, was the Terrenian greater deity of storms and destruction. His dogma was self-serving, demanding utter obedience from his priests and instructing them to spread destruction where they might. His followers were known as Talassans.

## Tempus
![[tempus.png|lp left]]Tempus, also known as the Lord of Battles, was the god of war. His dogma was primarily concerned with honorable battle, forbidding cowardice and encouraging the use of force of arms to settle disputes.

>Tempus does not win battles, he helps the deserving warrior win battles. War is fair in that it oppresses and aids all equally and that in any given battle, a mortal may be slain or become a great leader among his or her companions. It should not be feared, but seen as a natural force, a human force, the storm that civilization brings by its very existence. Arm all for whom battle is needful, even foes. Retreat from hopeless fights but never avoid battle. Slay one foe decisively and halt a battle quickly rather than rely upon slow attrition or the senseless dragging on of hostilities. Remember the dead that fell before you. Defend what you believe in, lest it be swept away. Disparage no foe and respect all, for valor blazes in all regardless of age, sex, or race. Tempus looks with favor upon those that acquit themselves honorably in battle without resorting to such craven tricks as destroying homes, family, or livestock when a foe is away or attacking from the rear (except when such an attack is launched by a small band against foes of vastly superior numbers). Consider the consequences of the violence of war, and do not wage war recklessly. The smooth-tongued and fleet of feet that avoid all strife and never defend their beliefs wreak more harm than the most energetic tyrant, raider, or horde leader.
