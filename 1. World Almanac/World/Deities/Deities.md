# **Deities of Terrene**

In the vast tapestry of Terrene, dozens of deities weave their influence, once created by the divine hands of Cinnarth and Stellabryn. As the godly creators departed, the diverse races of Terrene forged their own faiths, resulting in a pantheon of at least thirty widely-known deities. Beyond these, countless more find reverence in the hearts of local tribes, small cults, and sects within larger religious temples. Across the world, these deities are both revered and feared, their stories echoing through the ages, shaping the beliefs and destinies of those who dwell in the realms of Terrene.  
  
>_Note: These deities have been carried over from the Forgotten Realms setting with minor adjustments to better suit the campaign._
