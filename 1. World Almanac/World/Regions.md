| [[Utorim.png\|Utorim]] | The vibrant heart of the Eastern Continent in Terrene. Here, warring kingdoms shape a dynamic landscape of majestic cities and quaint villages, each a testament to the resilience and ambition of its people. Amidst the clash of power, the roads of Utorim invite adventurers to uncover secrets in a land where every city and village adds a unique chapter to the ongoing saga of Terrene.                                                                                                                  |
| Mortilis               | The desolate western continent of Terrene, now a haunting landscape ruled by the undead and supernatural beasts. Once home to thriving kingdoms and bustling cities, this forsaken realm now lies in ruin, swallowed by wild plant life and haunted by the restless souls of the departed. Mortilis stands as a grim testament to the relentless march of time, where the remnants of once-great civilizations now serve as a backdrop to the eerie symphony of undead creatures that roam its desolate expanses. |
| Underhollow            | A vast network of tunnels, caverns, and cities veiled in eternal darkness. Phosphorescent fungi illuminate the alien landscapes, where drow, duergar, and other denizens navigate the shadows. It's a realm of peril, home to lurking horrors and enigmatic civilizations, echoing with the whispers of distant battles. The UnderHollow beckons adventurers into its fathomless depths, promising both wonders and terrors in the perpetual night below.                                                         |
| The Shaard                       | A mythical realm suspended in the heavens by the ancient power of the dragon gods, was once the sanctuary of dragons now lost to myth. Hovering above a colossal storm named the Maelstrom, this floating continent is veiled in mystery. Legend holds that it houses the last of Terrene's dragons, shrouded in the enigmatic magic that defies mortal comprehension. Unexplored and untouched, the Shaard beckons as an unreachable realm, where the whispers of the dragons' legacy echo amidst the thunderous turbulence of the Maelstrom below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
