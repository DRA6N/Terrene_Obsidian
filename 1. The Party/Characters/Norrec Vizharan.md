> [!columns|no-icon] ## Class Features: Wizard - Necromancer
>> [!feature]- Arcane Recovery (1/Long Rest)
>> You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.
>> 
>> For example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.
>
>> [!feature]- Grim Harvest (Level 2)
>> You gain the ability to reap life energy from creatures you kill with your spells. Once per turn when you kill one or more creatures with a spell of 1st level or higher, you regain hit points equal to twice the spell's level, or three times its level if the spell belongs to the School of Necromancy. You don't gain this benefit for killing constructs or undead.
>
>>[!feature]- Undead Thralls (Level 6)
>>You add the Animate Dead spell to your spellbook if it is not there already. When you cast Animate Dead, you can target one additional corpse or pile of bones, creating another zombie or skeleton, as appropriate.
>>Whenever you create an undead using a necromancy spell, it has additional benefits:
>>- The creature's hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your wizard level.
>>- The creature adds your proficiency bonus to its weapon damage rolls.

> [!columns|no-icon] ## Feats / Traits
> > [!feat]- Shadow Touched (Human Varient)
> > Your exposure to the Shadowfell's magic has changed you, granting you the following benefits:
> > - Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
> > - You learn the Invisibility spell and one 1st-level spell of your choice. The 1st-level spell must be from the Illusion or Necromancy school of magic. You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either of these spells in this way, you can't cast that spell in this way again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spells' spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.
> 
> 
> >[!feat]- Gambling Addiction, Mild
> >She has a bit of a gambling addiction she has to sate once a while with mildÂ **Wisdom Saving Throw DC 11 Check**Â to not fall prone to gamble.
> >
> >Wisdom Saving Throw:  `dice:1d20+2`
> 
> > [!feat]- All Eyes on You (Background: Far Traveler)
> > Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign. Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands, to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear stories of your homeland.
> > 
> > You can parley this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested in hearing about your distant homeland and people.
> 
> 
> > [!feat]- Ability Score Improvement (Level 4)
> > When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
