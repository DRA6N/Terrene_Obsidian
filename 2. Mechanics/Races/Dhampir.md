# Dhampir

![[dhampir.jpg|lp left]]Born from the union of mortal and vampire, dhampirs come into the world infused with undead power but alive. Dhampirs typically cannot sire or bear children themselves although there are rare exceptions to this, typically aided by powerful magic. Although dhampirs share much in common they do vary based on the supernatural nature of their vampiric parent.

## One Foot in the Grave

Dhampirs straddle the line between life and death. Their mystical relation to undeath gives them resilience against poison and necromantic energies but they still fell the blush of life as keenly as any other mortal race. Dhampirs tend to be fascinated with mortality. In some cases this compels a dampir to take up the life of an adventurer, risking her life on a nightly basis just for the thrill. In other cases it causes a dhampir to cloister himself away from the world studiously working to conquer his own mortality.

## The Life Nocturnal

While the sun is not as offensive to dhampirs as it is to their vampiric parent, dhampirs nevertheless prefer the dim light and darkness of night to the harsh sunlight. Their aversion to sunlight is so typical that the highly superstitious or untrusting might assume that a dhampir is a vampire itself. Unlike their vampiric parents, dhampirs do not need to use the cover of darkness to carry out predation on the mortal population so instead many dhampirs acquaint themselves with the local nightlife and criminal organizations that operate largely in the evenings and wee hours of the morning.

## By Bloodline Broken

When a vampire passes down his blood to a dhampir child he passes along the curse that runs through his veins as well. Although more obscure curses certainly exist the three main curses that afflict vampires are the Curse of Nobility, the Curse of the Feral, and the Curse of Dread. Amongst dhampirs these translate to the Dreadblood, Feralblood, and Nobleblood.

Dreadblood dhampirs inspire terror and creeping melancholy in those around them and so tend to take up lives of study where they can hide away from others.

Feralblood dhampirs connect the bestial side of vampirism and are born warriors and feel most alive when taking a life.

Nobleblood dhampirs possess an unnatural charisma and hypnotic presence that they employ to build small communities and cults to their name and live off the hard work of others.
