## Rumors
| "I heard that,  one day last week, Ceolwy Mâze was seen with Vanira Fedoruk down near the Inn and nearby there was a dead monster. I heard it from a beggar so it is probably true." | "I heard that,  just before dawn, Jillian Forehand was seen with Biri down near the big city and nearby there was a horible monster I heard it from a peasant woman so it is likely true." | "I heard that,  earlier today,Vanira Fedoruk was seen with  an artefact down near Mâze's Amulets and nearby there was a dead monster. I heard it from a grocer so it isn't likely the whole story." |

## Plot Hooks
| Representatives of several evil cults, religions, and social groups are protesting and campaigning for the king to grant them equal status to all the good and neutral gods, religions, and social groups, claiming that Alignment is Not A Choice and since their gods are just as real as Good Gods, they deserve equal representation The PCs are hired to guard one of their rallies | An iron golem with a gem burning in its chest steals from rich merchant’s homes in a spectacularly noisy and destructive fashion and then vanishes into the sewers The thieves’ guild wants this amateur stopped Can the PCs figure out what’s really going on? | A streak of bad luck has hit town hard People have been injured in accidents, fires, sickness People report seeing a black cat near them before the accidents happen Confronting the cat should be entertaining as trying to harm it will only bring bad luck to the PCs (bow strings break, sword slips out of hand and gets lost, shoes become untied, etc) Catching it will be difficult as it is with any cat Best thing to do is follow it and see where it goes, which will lead them to a big tree that the cat enters The cat is actually a shape shifting spirit, a trickster, just having fun with the town The PCs will have to pass a test or riddle or perform some task for the spirit to get it to leave the town alone |
