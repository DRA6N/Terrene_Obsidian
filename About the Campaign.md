# About the Campaign   

The world of Terrene utilizes a custom world map along with its own politics, religions, and timeline.
   
## Lore

Cinnarth the Black, and Stellabryn the White were once two celestial dragon gods that created the world of Terrene. Stellabryn the White – creator of worlds, created all the living things that walked the lands, swam in the seas and flew in the skies. Cinnarth the Black – destroyer of all things, gave free will to man, allowing them to create their own destinies and seal their own fates.

Man began to worship the two dragons, as the world was at peace and all things lived in harmony. Over time, man began to wage wars with one-another. Great wars were fought over territories, religions, and power. No matter what battles were won, man was never satiated. They began hunting down dragons as a symbol of immortality and power. The two dragon-gods began to lose faith in humanity and decided to leave them to their own destruction.
   

Legend has it that Cinnarth and Stellabryn gathered their dragon-kin to a central location on a massive island. They combined their powers to ascend the great landmass into the skies, leaving a massive storm below known as the Maelstrom. This never-ending storm’s great fury has kept intruders from entering the floating island. All the dragons of the world were said to remain on this island, never to be seen again by mankind. Lore became legend, legend became myth – as mankind began to lose belief in dragons all together. Nobody has seen so much as a sign of a dragon in many centuries. It is said that dragons have gone extinct or left the world all together.
