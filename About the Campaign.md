## Lore

  
The tale of Cinnarth the Black and Stellabryn the White echoes through the ages, a myth that once shaped the very fabric of Terrene. Stellabryn, the benevolent creator, sculpted the diverse life that adorned the lands, seas, and skies. In contrast, Cinnarth, the harbinger of change, bestowed upon humanity the gift of free will, a double-edged sword allowing them to forge destinies and sow their own demise.

During the era of peace, mankind worshipped the celestial dragon gods, finding harmony in their existence. Yet, as the ages unfolded, humanity's nature revealed itself through wars waged over territory, religion, and power. The once-peaceful world descended into chaos, and dragons, once revered, became trophies sought for immortality and dominion.

Disillusioned by mankind's descent into self-destruction, Cinnarth and Stellabryn, with heavy hearts, gathered their dragon-kin on a massive island. Uniting their powers, they ascended the landmass into the skies, leaving a tumultuous storm below—the Maelstrom—an eternal guardian warding off intruders. This floating island, a haven for dragons, became a sanctuary away from the turbulent world.

As the centuries passed, the lore of dragons faded into legend and myth. The once-mighty beings were believed to have gone extinct or departed the world entirely. The Maelstrom stood as a testament to the dragons' departure, an enduring reminder of the price of humanity's choices. Though the world continued without the celestial dragons, the whispers of their legacy lingered in the shadows, waiting to be unveiled by those who dared to seek the truth.
