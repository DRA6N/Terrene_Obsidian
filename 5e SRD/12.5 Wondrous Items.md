#### Amulet of Health

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

Your [[06. Abilities#^a43e50|Constitution]] score is 19 while you wear this amulet. It has no effect on you if your [[06. Abilities#^a43e50|Constitution]] is already 19 or higher.

#### Amulet of Proof against Detection and Location

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

While wearing this amulet, you are hidden from divination magic. You can't be targeted by such magic or perceived through magical [[10. Spells#Scrying|scrying]] sensors.

#### Amulet of the Planes

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

While wearing this amulet, you can use an action to name a location that you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15 [Intelligence](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence) check. On a successful check, you cast the [plane shift](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/plane-shift) spell. On a failure, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination. Roll a d100. On a 1--60, you travel to a random location on the plane you named. On a 61--100, you travel to a randomly determined plane of existence.

#### Apparatus of the Crab

Wondrous item, legendary

This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 [Intelligence](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence) (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.

The apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with the following statistics:

Armor Class: 20\
Hit Points: 200\
Speed: 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren't extended)\
Damage Immunities: poison, psychic

To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.

The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.

A creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of the Crab Levers table.

Apparatus of Crab Levers

| Lever | Up | Down |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Legs and tail extend, allowing the apparatus to walk and swim. | Legs and tail retract, reducing the apparatus's speed to 0 and making it unable to benefit from bonuses to speed. |
| 2 | Forward window shutter opens. | Forward window shutters closes. |
| 3 | Side window shutters open (two per side). | Side window shutters close (two per side). |
| 4 | Two claws extend from the front sides of the apparatus. | The claws retract. |
| 5 | Each extended claw makes the following melee weapon attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage. | Each extended claw makes the following melee weapon [attack](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack): +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: The target is [grappled](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Grappled) (escape DC 15). |
| 6 | The apparatus walks or swims forward. | The apparatus walks or swims backward. |
| 7 | The apparatus turns 90 degrees left. | The apparatus turns 90 degrees right. |
| 8 | Eyelike fixtures emit bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. | The light turns off. |
| 9 | The apparatus sinks as much as 20 feet in liquid. | The apparatus rises up to 20 feet in liquid. |
| 10 | The rear hatch unseals and opens. | The rear hatch closes and seals. |

#### Bag of Beans

Wondrous item, rare

Inside this heavy cloth bag are 3d4 dry beans. The bag weighs 1/2 pound plus 1/4 pound for each bean it contains.

If you dump the bag's contents out on the ground, they explode in a 10-foot radius, extending from the beans. Each creature in the area, including you, must make a DC 15 [Dexterity](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity) saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The GM can choose an effect from the following table, determine it randomly, or create an effect.

| d100 | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| 01 | 5d4 toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a toadstool, roll any die. On an odd roll, the eater must succeed on a DC 15 [Constitution](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Constitution) saving throw or take 5d6 poison damage and become [poisoned](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Poisoned) for 1 hour. On an even roll, the eater gains 5d6 [temporary hit points](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points) for 1 hour. |
| 02-10 | A geyser erupts and spouts water, beer, berry juice, tea, vinegar, wine, or oil (GM's choice) 30 feet into the air for 1d12 rounds. |
| 11-20 | A treant sprouts. There's a 50 percent chance that the treant is chaotic evil and attacks. |
| 21-30 | An animate, immobile stone statue in your likeness rises. It makes verbal threats against you. If you leave it and others come near, it describes you as the most heinous of villains and directs the newcomers to find and attack you. If you are on the same plane of existence as the statue, it knows where you are. The statue becomes inanimate after 24 hours. |
| 31-40 | A campfire with blue flames springs forth and burns for 24 hours (or until it is extinguished). |
| 41-50 | 1d6 + 6 shriekers sprout |
| 51-60 | 1d4 + 8 bright pink toads crawl forth. Whenever a toad is touched, it transforms into a Large or smaller monster of the GM's choice. The monster remains for 1 minute, then disappears in a puff of bright pink smoke. |
| 61-70 | A hungry bulette burrows up and attacks. |
| 71-80 | A fruit tree grows. It has 1d10+20 fruit, 1d8 of which act as randomly determined magic potions, while one acts as an ingested poison of the GM's choice. The tree vanishes after 1 hour. Picked fruit remains, retaining any magic for 30 days. |
| 81-90 | A nest of 1d4 + 3 eggs springs up. Any creature that eats an egg must make a DC 20 [Constitution](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Constitution) saving throw. On a successful save, a creature permanently increases its lowest ability score by 1, randomly choosing among equally low scores. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 force damage from an internal magical explosion. |
| 91-99 | A pyramid with a 60-foot-square base bursts upward. Inside is a sarcophagus containing a mummy lord. The pyramid is treated as the mummy lord's lair, and its sarcophagus contains treasure of the GM's choice. |
| 00 | A giant beanstalk sprouts, growing to a height of the GM's choice. The top leads where the GM chooses, such as to a great view, a cloud giant's castle, or a different plane of existence. |

#### Bag of Devouring

Wondrous item, very rare

This bag superficially resembles a bag of holding but is a feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.

The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 [Strength](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Strength) check.

Another creature can use its action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 [Strength](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Strength) check (provided it isn't pulled inside the bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.

Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The GM determines the time and plane.

If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.

#### Bag of Holding

Wondrous item, uncommon

This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.

If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again.

Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.

Placing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional space created by a handy haversack, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a [gate](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/gate) to the Astral Plane. The [gate](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/gate) originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the [gate](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/gate) is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The [gate](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/gate) then closes. The [gate](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/gate) is one-way only and can't be reopened.

#### Bag of Tricks

Wondrous item, uncommon

This ordinary bag, made from gray, rust, or tan cloth, appears empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals the presence of a small, fuzzy object. The bag weighs 1/2 pound.

You can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling a d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to the bag's color.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a [bonus action](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat/?uniqparam=OTVmZjAyMjA1Y2I2MzdjMjI5ZDZjZDRiYzY5NzNlYzM/#Bonus_Actions) to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature.

Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can't be used again until the next dawn.

#### Bead of Force

Wondrous item, rare

This small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in diameter and weighs an ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 4 beads of force are found together.

You can use an action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. The bead explodes on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of where the bead landed must succeed on a DC 15 [Dexterity](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity) saving throw or take 5d4 force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere's wall. No [attack](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack) or other effect can.

An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature's walking speed. The sphere can be picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.

#### Belt of Dwarvenkind

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

While wearing this belt, you gain the following benefits:

#### Belt of Giant Strength

Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)

If your [Strength](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Strength) is already equal to or greater than the belt's score, the item has no effect on you.

Six varieties of this belt exist, corresponding with and having rarity according to the six kinds of true giants. The belt of stone giant strength and the belt of frost giant strength look different, but they have the same effect.

| Type | Strength | Rarity |

If you do, the boots double your walking speed, and any creature that makes an opportunity [attack](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack) against you has disadvantage on the [attack](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack) roll. If you click your heels together again, you end the effect.

When the boots' property has been used for a total of 10 minutes, the magic ceases to function until you finish a [long rest](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/the-environment/#Long_Rest).

#### Boots of Striding and Springing

While you wear these boots, your walking speed becomes 30 feet, unless your walking speed is higher, and your speed isn't reduced if you are encumbered or wearing heavy armor.

Wondrous item, rare

While this bowl is filled with water, you can use an action to speak the bowl's command word and summon a water elemental, as if you had cast the [conjure elemental](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/conjur-elemental) spell. The bowl can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

#### Broom of Flying

Wondrous item, uncommon

This wooden broom, which weighs 3 pounds, functions like a mundane broom until you stand astride it and speak its command word. It then hovers beneath you and can be ridden in the air. It has a flying speed of 50 feet. It can carry up to 400 pounds, but its flying speed becomes 30 feet while carrying over 200 pounds. The broom stops hovering when you land.

You can send the broom to travel alone to a destination within 1 mile of you if you speak the command word, name the location, and are familiar with that place. The broom comes back to you when you speak another command word, provided that the broom is still within 1 mile of you.

#### Candle of Invocation

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

This slender taper is dedicated to a deity and shares that deity's alignment. The candle's alignment can be detected with the [detect evil and good](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/detect-evil-and-good) spell. The GM chooses the god and associated alignment or determines the alignment randomly.

| d20 | Alignment |
| --- | --- |
| 1-2 | Chaotic Evil |
| 3-4 | Chaotic Neutral |
| 5-7 | Chaotic Good |

| 14-15 | Lawful Evil |
| 16-17 | Lawful Neutral |
| 18-20 | Lawful Good |

The candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires an action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from the candle's total burn time.

While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment matches that of the candle makes [attack](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack) rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with advantage. In addition, a [cleric](https://www.5esrd.com/classes/cleric) or [druid](https://www.5esrd.com/classes/druid) in the light whose alignment matches the candle's can cast 1st- level spells he or she has prepared without expending spell slots, though the spell's effect is as if cast with a 1st-level slot.

Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast the [gate](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/gate) spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle.

#### Cape of the Mountebank

Wondrous item, rare

This cape smells faintly of brimstone. While wearing it, you can use it to cast the [dimension door](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/dimension-door) spell as an action. This property of the cape can't be used again until the next dawn.

When you disappear, you leave behind a cloud of smoke, and you appear in a similar cloud of smoke at your destination. The smoke lightly obscures the space you left and the space you appear in, and it dissipates at the end of your next turn. A light or stronger wind disperses the smoke.

#### Carpet of Flying

Wondrous item, very rare

You can speak the carpet's command word as an action to make the carpet hover and fly. It moves according to your spoken directions, provided that you are within 30 feet of it.

Four sizes of carpet of flying exist. The GM chooses the size of a given carpet or determines it randomly.

| d100 | Size | Capacity | Flying Speed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| 21-55 | 4 ft. x 6 ft. | 400 lb | 60 ft. |
| 56-80 | 5 ft. x 7 ft. | 600 lb. | 40 ft. |
| 81-100 | 6 ft. x 9 ft. | 800 lb | 30 ft. |

A carpet can carry up to twice the weight shown on the table, but it flies at half speed if it carries more than its normal capacity.

#### Censer of Controlling Air Elementals

Wondrous item, rare

While incense is burning in this censer, you can use an action to speak the censer's command word and summon an air elemental, as if you had cast the [conjure elemental](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/conjur-elemental) spell. The censer can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

This 6-inch-wide, 1-foot-high vessel resembles a chalice with a decorated lid. It weighs 1 pound.

#### Chime of Opening

Wondrous item, rare

This hollow metal tube measures about 1 foot long and weighs 1 pound. You can strike it as an action, pointing it at an object within 120 feet of you that can be opened, such as a door, lid, or lock. The chime issues a clear tone, and one lock or latch on the object opens unless the sound can't reach the object. If no locks or latches remain, the object itself opens.

The chime can be used ten times. After the tenth time, it cracks and becomes useless.

#### Circlet of Blasting

Wondrous item, uncommon

While wearing this circlet, you can use an action to cast the [scorching ray](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/scorching-ray) spell with it. When you make the spell's attacks, you do so with an [attack](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack) bonus of +5. The circlet can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

#### Cloak of Displacement

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

While you wear this cloak, it projects an illusion that makes you appear to be standing in a place near your actual location, causing any creature to have disadvantage on [attack](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack) rolls against you. If you take damage, the property ceases to function until the start of your next turn. This property is suppressed while you are incapacitated, [restrained](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Restrained), or otherwise unable to move.

#### Cloak of Elvenkind

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

While you wear this cloak with its hood up, [Wisdom](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom) (Perception) checks made to see you have disadvantage, and you have advantage on [Dexterity](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity) (Stealth) checks made to [hide](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hide), as the cloak's color shifts to camouflage you.

In an area of dim light or darkness, you can grip the edges of the cloak with both hands and use it to fly at a speed of 40 feet. If you ever fail to grip the cloak's edges while flying in this way, or if you are no longer in dim light or darkness, you lose this flying speed.

While wearing the cloak in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to cast [polymorph](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/polymorph) on yourself, transforming into a bat. While you are in the form of the bat, you retain your [Intelligence](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence), [Wisdom](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom), and [Charisma](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Charisma) scores. The cloak can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

The following crystal ball variants are legendary items and have additional properties.

Crystal Ball of Mind Reading: You can use an action to cast the [detect thoughts](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/detect-thoughts) spell (save DC 17) while you are [scrying](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/scrying) with the crystal ball, targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You don't need to concentrate on this [detect thoughts](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/detect-thoughts) to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if [scrying](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/scrying) ends.

Crystal Ball of Telepathy: While [scrying](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/scrying) with the crystal ball, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You can also use an action to cast the [suggestion](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/suggestion) spell (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don't need to concentrate on this [suggestion](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/suggestion) to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if [scrying](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/scrying) ends. Once used, the [suggestion](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/suggestion) power of the crystal ball can't be used again until the next dawn.

> Crystal Ball of True Seeing: While [scrying](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/scrying) with the crystal ball, you have [truesight](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/the-environment/#Truesight) with a radius of 120 feet centered on the spell's sensor.

#### Cube of Force

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

This cube is about an inch across. Each face has a distinct marking on it that can be pressed. The cube starts with 36 charges, and it regains 1d20 expended charges daily at dawn.

You can use an action to press one of the cube's faces, expending a number of charges based on the chosen face, as shown in the Cube of Force Faces table. Each face has a different effect. If the cube has insufficient charges remaining, nothing happens.

Otherwise, a barrier of invisible force springs into existence, forming a cube 15 feet on a side. The barrier is centered on you, moves with you, and lasts for 1 minute, until you use an action to press the cube's sixth face, or the cube runs out of charges.

You can change the barrier's effect by pressing a different face of the cube and expending the requisite number of charges, resetting the duration.

If your movement causes the barrier to come into contact with a solid object that can't pass through the cube, you can't move any closer to that object as long as the barrier remains.

Cube of Force Faces

| Face | Charges | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | Gases, wind, and fog can't pass through the barrier. |
| 2 | 2 | Nonliving matter can't pass through the barrier. Walls, floors, and ceilings can pass through at your discretion. |
| 3 | 3 | Living matter can't pass through the barrier. |
| 4 | 4 | Spell effects can't pass through the barrier. |
| 5 | 5 | Nothing can pass through the barrier. Walls, floors, and ceilings can pass through at your discretion. |
| 6 | 0 | The barrier deactivates. |

The cube loses charges when the barrier is targeted by certain spells or comes into contact with certain spell or magic item effects, as shown in the table below.

| Spell or Item | Charges Lost |
| --- | --- |
| [Disintegrate](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/disintegrate) | 1d12 |
| Horn of Blasting | 1d10 |
| [Passwall](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/passwall) | 1d6 |
| [Prismatic Spray](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/prismaticspray) | 1d20 |
| [Wall of Fire](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/wall-of-fire) | 1d4 |

#### Cubic Gate

Wondrous item, legendary

This cube is 3 inches across and radiates palpable magical energy. The six sides of the cube are each keyed to a different plane of existence, one of which is the Material Plane. The other sides are linked to planes determined by the GM.

You can use an action to press one side of the cube to cast the [gate](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/gate) spell with it, opening a portal to the plane keyed to that side. Alternatively, if you use an action to press one side twice, you can cast the [plane shift](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/plane-shift) spell (save DC 17) with the cube and transport the targets to the plane keyed to that side.

The cube has 3 charges. Each use of the cube expends 1 charge. The cube regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

#### Decanter of Endless Water

Wondrous item, uncommon

This stoppered flask sloshes when shaken, as if it contains water. The decanter weighs 2 pounds.

You can use an action to remove the stopper and speak one of three command words, whereupon an amount of fresh water or salt water (your choice) pours out of the flask. The water stops pouring out at the start of your next turn. Choose from the following options:

-   "Stream" produces 1 gallon of water.
-   "Fountain" produces 5 gallons of water.
-   "Geyser" produces 30 gallons of water that gushes forth in a geyser 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. As a [bonus action](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat/?uniqparam=OTVmZjAyMjA1Y2I2MzdjMjI5ZDZjZDRiYzY5NzNlYzM/#Bonus_Actions) while holding the decanter, you can aim the geyser at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 13 [Strength](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Strength) saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall [prone](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Being-Prone). Instead of a creature, you can target an object that isn't being worn or carried and that weighs no more than 200 pounds. The object is either knocked over or pushed up to 15 feet away from you.

#### Deck of Illusions

Wondrous item, uncommon

This box contains a set of parchment cards. A full deck has 34 cards. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 - 1 cards.

The magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). You can use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of you.

An illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 [Intelligence](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence) (Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.

The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled. When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can't be used again.

#### Deck of Many Things

Wondrous item, legendary

Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two.

Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.

Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.

*Found only in a deck with twenty-two cards

Balance: Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.

Comet: If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.

Donjon: You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any [divination](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/divination) magic, but a [wish](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/wish) spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.

Euryale. The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.

The Fates: Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.

Flames: A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.

Fool: You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.

Gem: Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.

Idiot: Permanently reduce your [Intelligence](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence) by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.

Jester: You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.

Key: A rare or rarer [magic weapon](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/magic-weapon) with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.

Knight: You gain the service of a 4th-level [fighter](https://www.5esrd.com/classes/fighter) who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The [fighter](https://www.5esrd.com/classes/fighter) is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.

Moon: You are granted the ability to cast the [wish](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/wish) spell 1d3 times.

Rogue: A nonplayer character of the GM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a [wish](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/wish) spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.

Ruin: All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.

Skull. You summon an avatar of death---a ghostly [humanoid](http://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/monsters-by-type/humanoids/) skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to [0 hit points](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Dropping-to-0-Hit-Points), whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to [help](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Help) you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.

size:14px;border-top-left-radius:5px;border-top-right-radius:5px"> [Actions](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Actions-in-Combat)

-   Reaping Scythe: The avatar sweeps its spectral scythe through a creature within 5 feet of it, dealing 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage.

Star: Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24.

Sun: You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the GM determines randomly) appears in your hands.

Talons: Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren't destroyed but do vanish.

Throne: You gain proficiency in the [Persuasion](http://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores/#Persuasion) skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.

Vizier: At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.

The Void: This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A [wish](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/wish) spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.

#### Dimensional Shackles

Wondrous item, rare

You can use an action to place these shackles on an incapacitated creature. The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large [size](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Creature-Size). In addition to serving as mundane manacles, the shackles prevent a creature bound by them from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. They don't prevent the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal.

You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can use an action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 [Strength](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Strength) (Athletics) check. On a success, the creature breaks free and destroys the shackles.

#### Dust of Disappearance

Wondrous item, uncommon

Found in a small packet, this powder resembles very fine sand. There is enough of it for one use. When you use an action to throw the dust into the air, you and each creature and object within 10 feet of you become invisible for 2d4 minutes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and the dust is consumed when its magic takes effect. If a creature affected by the dust attacks or casts a spell, the [invisibility](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/invisibility) ends for that creature.

#### Dust of Dryness

Wondrous item, uncommon

This small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust. You can use an action to sprinkle a pinch of it over water. The dust turns a cube of water 15 feet on a side into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet's weight is negligible.

Someone can use an action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to [shatter](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/shatter) and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so ends that pellet's magic.

An elemental composed mostly of water that is exposed to a pinch of the dust must make a DC 13 [Constitution](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Constitution) saving throw, taking 10d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Dust of Sneezing and Choking

Wondrous item, uncommon

Found in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand. It appears to be dust of disappearance, and an [identify](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/identify) spell reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.

When you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 [Constitution](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Constitution) saving throw or become unable to breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is incapacitated and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success. The [lesser restoration](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/lesser-restoration) spell can also end the effect on a creature.

#### Efficient Quiver

Wondrous item, uncommon

Each of the quiver's three compartments connects to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to sixty arrows, bolts, or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to eighteen javelins or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up to six long objects, such as bows, quarterstaffs, or spears.

You can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.

#### Efreeti Bottle

Wondrous item, very rare

This painted brass bottle weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of the bottle. At the end of [your turn](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Your-Turn), the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an efreeti appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.

The first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls to determine what happens.

| d100 | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| 01--10 | The efreeti attacks you. After fighting for 5 rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the bottle loses its magic. |
| 11--90 | The efreeti serves you for 1 hour, doing as you command. Then the efreeti returns to the bottle, and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can't be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the bottle is opened a fourth time, the efreeti escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its magic. |
| 91--00 | The efreeti can cast the [wish](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/wish) spell three times for you. It disappears when it grants the final [wish](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/wish) or after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic. |

#### Elemental Gem

Wondrous item, uncommon

This gem contains a mote of elemental energy. When you use an action to break the gem, an elemental is summoned as if you had cast the [conjure elemental](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/conjur-elemental) spell, and the gem's magic is lost. The type of gem determines the elemental summoned by the spell.

| Gem | Summoned Elemental |
| --- | --- |
| Blue sapphire | Air elemental |
| Yellow diamond | Earth elemental |
| Red corundum | Fire elemental |
| Emerald | Water elemental |

#### Eversmoking Bottle

Wondrous item, uncommon

Smoke leaks from the lead-stoppered mouth of this brass bottle, which weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke pours out in a 60-foot radius from the bottle. The cloud's area is heavily [obscured](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/hazards/darkness-obscurement/#Obscurement). Each minute the bottle remains open and within the cloud, the radius increases by 10 feet until it reaches its maximum radius of 120 feet.

The cloud persists as long as the bottle is open. Closing the bottle requires you to speak its command word as an action. Once the bottle is closed, the cloud disperses after 10 minutes. A moderate wind (11 to 20 miles per hour) can also disperse the smoke after 1 minute, and a strong wind (21 or more miles per hour) can do so after 1 round.

#### Eyes of Charming

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3 charges. While wearing them, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the [charm person](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/charm-person) spell (save DC 13) on a [humanoid](http://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/monsters-by-type/humanoids/) within 30 feet of you, provided that you and the target can see each other. The lenses regain all expended charges daily at dawn.

#### Eyes of Minute Seeing

Wondrous item, uncommon

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you can see much better than normal out to a range of 1 foot. You have advantage on [Intelligence](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence) (Investigation) checks that rely on sight while searching an area or studying an object within that range.

#### Eyes of the Eagle

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you have advantage on [Wisdom](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom) (Perception) checks that rely on sight. In conditions of clear visibility, you can make out details of even extremely distant creatures and objects as small as 2 feet across.

#### Feather Token

Wondrous item, rare

This tiny object looks like a feather. Different types of feather tokens exist, each with a different single- use effect. The GM chooses the kind of token or determines it randomly.

| d100 | Feather Token |
| --- | --- |
| 01--20 | Anchor |
| 21--35 | Bird |
| 36--50 | Fan |
| 51--65 | Swan boat |
| 66--90 | Tree |
| 91--00 | Whip |

Anchor: You can use an action to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can't be moved by any means. Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears.

Bird: You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a roc, but it obeys your simple commands and can't [attack](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack). It can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles an hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a one-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying), or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to [0 hit points](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Dropping-to-0-Hit-Points). You can dismiss the bird as an action.

Fan: If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a wind strong enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as an action.

Swan Boat: You can use an action to touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-foot-long, 20-foot- wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can use an action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat can carry up to thirty-two Medium or smaller creatures. A Large creature counts as four Medium creatures, while a Huge creature counts as nine. The boat remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as an action.

Tree: You must be outdoors to use this token. You can use an action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.

Whip: You can use an action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then use a [bonus action](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat/?uniqparam=OTVmZjAyMjA1Y2I2MzdjMjI5ZDZjZDRiYzY5NzNlYzM/#Bonus_Actions) to make a melee spell [attack](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack) against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an [attack](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack) bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 force damage.

As a [bonus action](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat/?uniqparam=OTVmZjAyMjA1Y2I2MzdjMjI5ZDZjZDRiYzY5NzNlYzM/#Bonus_Actions) on [your turn](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Your-Turn), you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the [attack](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack) against a creature within 10 feet of it. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you use an action to dismiss it, or when you are incapacitated or die.

#### Figurine of Wondrous Power

Wondrous item, rarity by figurine

A figurine of wondrous power is a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other [actions](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Actions-in-Combat).

The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to [0 hit points](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Dropping-to-0-Hit-Points) or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.

Bronze Griffon (Rare): This bronze statuette is of a griffon rampant. It can become a griffon for up to 6 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.

Ebony Fly (Rare): This ebony statuette is carved in the likeness of a horsefly. It can become a giant fly for up to 12 hours and can be ridden as a mount.

Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed.

Golden Lions (Rare): These gold statuettes of lions are always created in pairs. You can use one figurine or both simultaneously. Each can become a lion for up to 1 hour. Once a lion has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

Ivory Goats (Rare): These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:

-   The goat of traveling can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.
-   The goat of travail becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.
-   The goat of terror becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can't [attack](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack), but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a +1 lance, and the other becomes a +2 longsword. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 [Wisdom](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom) saving throw or be [frightened](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Frightened) of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The [frightened](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Frightened) creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat's aura for the next 24 hours.

Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.

Marble Elephant (Rare): This marble statuette is about 4 inches high and long. It can become an elephant for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

Obsidian Steed (Very Rare). This polished obsidian horse can become a nightmare for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself.

Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.

If you have a good alignment, the figurine has a 10 percent chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine form.

Onyx Dog (Rare): This onyx statuette of a dog can become a mastiff for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has an [Intelligence](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence) of 8 and can speak Common. It also has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and can see invisible creatures and objects within that range.

Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

Serpentine Owl (Rare): This serpentine statuette of an owl can become a giant owl for up to 8 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. The owl can telepathically communicate with you at any range if you and it are on the same plane of existence.

Silver Raven (Uncommon): This silver statuette of a raven can become a raven for up to 12 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. While in raven form, the figurine allows you to cast the [animal messenger](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/animal-messenger) spell on it at will.

#### Folding Boat

Wondrous item, rare

This object appears as a wooden box that measures 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It weighs 4 pounds and floats. It can be opened to store items inside. This item also has three command words, each requiring you to use an action to speak it.

One command word causes the box to unfold into a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet deep. The boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. The boat can hold up to four Medium creatures comfortably.

The second command word causes the box to unfold into a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. The ship has a deck, rowing seats, five sets of oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The ship can hold fifteen Medium creatures comfortably.

When the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal vessel its size, and anything that was stored in the box remains in the boat.

The third command word causes the folding boat to fold back into a box, provided that no creatures are aboard. Any objects in the vessel that can't fit inside the box remain outside the box as it folds. Any objects in the vessel that can fit inside the box do so.

#### Gauntlets of Ogre Power

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

Your [Strength](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Strength) score is 19 while you wear these gauntlets. They have no effect on you if your [Strength](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Strength) is already 19 or higher.

#### Gem of Brightness

Wondrous item, uncommon

This prism has 50 charges. While you are holding it, you can use an action to speak one of three command words to cause one of the following effects:

-   The first command word causes the gem to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn't expend a charge. It lasts until you use a [bonus action](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat/?uniqparam=OTVmZjAyMjA1Y2I2MzdjMjI5ZDZjZDRiYzY5NzNlYzM/#Bonus_Actions) to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem.
-   The second command word expends 1 charge and causes the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 [Constitution](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Constitution) saving throw or become [blinded](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Blinded) for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
-   The third command word expends 5 charges and causes the gem to flare with blinding light in a 30- foot cone originating from it. Each creature in the cone must make a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word.

When all of the gem's charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 gp.

#### Gem of Seeing

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

This gem has 3 charges. As an action, you can speak the gem's command word and expend 1 charge. For the next 10 minutes, you have [truesight](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/the-environment/#Truesight) out to 120 feet when you peer through the gem.

The gem regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

#### Gloves of Missile Snaring

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

These gloves seem to almost meld into your hands when you don them. When a ranged weapon [attack](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack) hits you while you're wearing them, you can use your [reaction](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reactions) to reduce the damage by 1d10 + your [Dexterity](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity) modifier, provided that you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in that hand.

#### Gloves of Swimming and Climbing

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

While wearing these gloves, climbing and swimming don't cost you extra movement, and you gain a +5 bonus to [Strength](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Strength) (Athletics) checks made to climb or swim.

#### Goggles of Night

Wondrous item, uncommon

While wearing these dark lenses, you have [darkvision](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, wearing the goggles increases its range by 60 feet.

#### Handy Haversack

Wondrous item, rare

This backpack has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which is an extradimensional space. Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.

Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.

The haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.

Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a [gate](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/gate) to the Astral Plane. The [gate](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/gate) originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the [gate](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/gate) is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The [gate](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/gate) then closes. The [gate](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/gate) is one-way only and can't be reopened.

#### Hat of Disguise

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

While wearing this hat, you can use an action to cast the [disguise self](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/disguise-self) spell from it at will. The spell ends if the hat is removed.

#### Headband of Intellect

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

Your [Intelligence](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence) score is 19 while you wear this headband. It has no effect on you if your [Intelligence](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence) is already 19 or higher.

#### Helm of Brilliance

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

This dazzling helm is set with 1d10 diamonds, 2d10 rubies, 3d10 fire opals, and 4d10 opals. Any gem pried from the helm crumbles to dust. When all the gems are removed or destroyed, the helm loses its magic.

You gain the following benefits while wearing it:

-   You can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18), using one of the helm's gems of the specified type as a component: [daylight](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/daylight) (opal), [fireball](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/fireball) (fire opal), [prismatic spray](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/prismaticspray) (diamond), or [wall of fire](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/wall-of-fire) (ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.
-   As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits dim light in a 30-foot radius when at least one undead is within that area. Any undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant damage.
-   As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have [resistance](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Damage-Resistance-and-Vulnerability) to fire damage.
-   As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can use an action and speak a command word to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an [attack](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack) using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The flames last until you use a [bonus action](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat/?uniqparam=OTVmZjAyMjA1Y2I2MzdjMjI5ZDZjZDRiYzY5NzNlYzM/#Bonus_Actions) to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow the weapon.

Roll a d20 if you are wearing the helm and take fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems. Each creature within 60 feet of the helm other than you must succeed on a DC 17 [Dexterity](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity) saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm. The helm and its gems are then destroyed.

#### Helm of Comprehending Languages

Wondrous item, uncommon

While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the [comprehend languages](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/comprehend-languages) spell from it at will.

#### Helm of Telepathy

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the [detect thoughts](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/detect-thoughts) spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain concentration on the spell, you can use a [bonus action](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat/?uniqparam=OTVmZjAyMjA1Y2I2MzdjMjI5ZDZjZDRiYzY5NzNlYzM/#Bonus_Actions) to send a telepathic [message](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/message) to a creature you are focused on. It can reply---using a [bonus action](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat/?uniqparam=OTVmZjAyMjA1Y2I2MzdjMjI5ZDZjZDRiYzY5NzNlYzM/#Bonus_Actions) to do so---while your focus on it continues.

While focusing on a creature with [detect thoughts](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/detect-thoughts), you can use an action to cast the [suggestion](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/suggestion) spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that creature. Once used, the [suggestion](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/suggestion) property can't be used again until the next dawn.

#### Helm of Teleportation

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

This helm has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the [teleport](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/teleport) spell from it. The helm regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

#### Horn of Blasting

Wondrous item, rare

You can use an action to speak the horn's command word and then blow the horn, which emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible 600 feet away. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 [Constitution](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Constitution) saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 thunder damage and is [deafened](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Deafened) for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't [deafened](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Deafened). Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw and take 10d6 thunder damage instead of 5d6.

Each use of the horn's magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals 10d6 fire damage to the blower and destroys the horn.

#### Horn of Valhalla

Wondrous item, rare (silver or brass), very rare (bronze), or legendary (iron)

You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the Valhalla appear within 60 feet of you. They use the statistics of a berserker.

They return to Valhalla after 1 hour or when they drop to [0 hit points](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Dropping-to-0-Hit-Points). Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

Four types of horn of Valhalla are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn's type determines how many berserkers answer its summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The GM chooses the horn's type or determines it randomly.

| d100 | Horn Type | Berserkers Summoned | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01--40 | Silver | 2d4 + 2 | None |
| 41--75 | Brass | 3d4 + 3 | Proficiency with all simple weapons |
| 76--90 | Bronze | 4d4 + 4 | Proficiency with all medium armor |
| 91--00 | Iron | 5d4 + 5 | Proficiency with all martial weapons |

If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned berserkers [attack](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack) you. If you meet the requirement, they are friendly to you and your companions and follow your commands.

#### Horseshoes of a Zephyr

Wondrous item, very rare

These iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they allow the creature to move normally while floating 4 inches above the ground. This effect means the creature can cross or stand above nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and ignores [difficult terrain](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Difficult-Terrain). In addition, the creature can move at normal speed for up to 12 hours a day without suffering [exhaustion](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Exhaustion) from a forced march.

#### Horseshoes of Speed

Wondrous item, rare

#### Restorative Ointment

Wondrous item, uncommon

This glass jar, 3 inches in diameter, contains 1d4 + 1 doses of a thick mixture that smells faintly of aloe. The jar and its contents weigh 1/2 pound.

As an action, one dose of the ointment can be swallowed or applied to the skin. The creature that receives it regains 2d8 + 2 [hit points](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points), ceases to be [poisoned](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Poisoned), and is cured of any disease.

#### Robe of Eyes

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

This robe is adorned with eyelike patterns. While you wear the robe, you gain the following benefits:

-   The robe lets you see in all directions, and you have advantage on [Wisdom](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom) (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
-   You have [darkvision](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/darkvision) out to a range of 120 feet.
-   You can see invisible creatures and objects, as well as see into the Ethereal Plane, out to a range of 120 feet.

The eyes on the robe can't be closed or averted. Although you can close or avert your own eyes, you are never considered to be doing so while wearing this robe.

A [light](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/light) spell cast on the robe or a [daylight](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/daylight) spell cast within 5 feet of the robe causes you to be [blinded](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Blinded) for 1 minute. At the end of each of your turns, you can make a [Constitution](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Constitution) saving throw (DC 11 for [light](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/light) or DC 15 for [daylight](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/daylight)), ending the blindness on a success.

#### Robe of Scintillating Colors

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

This robe has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While you wear it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cause the garment to display a shifting pattern of dazzling hues until the end of your next turn. During this time, the robe sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Creatures that can see you have disadvantage on [attack](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack) rolls against you. In addition, any creature in the bright light that can see you when the robe's power is activated must succeed on a DC 15 [Wisdom](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom) saving throw or become [stunned](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Stunned) until the effect ends.

#### Robe of Stars

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

This black or dark blue robe is embroidered with small white or silver stars. You gain a +1 bonus to saving throws while you wear it.

Six stars, located on the robe's upper front portion, are particularly large. While wearing this robe, you can use an action to pull off one of the stars and use it to cast [magic missile](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/magic-missile) as a 5th-level spell. Daily at dusk, 1d6 removed stars reappear on the robe.

While you wear the robe, you can use an action to enter the Astral Plane along with everything you are wearing and carrying. You remain there until you use an action to return to the plane you were on. You reappear in the last space you occupied, or if that space is occupied, the nearest unoccupied space.

#### Robe of the Archmagi

Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a [sorcerer](https://www.5esrd.com/classes/sorcerer), [warlock](https://www.5esrd.com/classes/warlock), or [wizard](https://www.5esrd.com/classes/wizard))

This elegant garment is made from exquisite cloth of white, gray, or black and adorned with silvery runes. The robe's color corresponds to the alignment for which the item was created. A white robe was made for good, gray for neutral, and black for evil. You can't attune to a robe of the archmagi that doesn't correspond to your alignment.

You gain these benefits while wearing the robe:

-   If you aren't wearing armor, your base Armor Class is 15 + your [Dexterity](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity) modifier.
-   You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
-   Your spell save DC and spell [attack](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack) bonus each increase by 2.

#### Robe of Useful Items

Wondrous item, uncommon

This robe has cloth patches of various shapes and colors covering it. While wearing the robe, you can use an action to detach one of the patches, causing it to become the object or creature it represents. Once the last patch is removed, the robe becomes an ordinary garment.

The robe has two of each of the following patches:

-   Dagger
-   Bullseye lantern (filled and lit)
-   Steel mirror
-   10-foot pole
-   Hempen rope (50 feet, coiled)

| 97--00 | Portable ram |

#### Instant Fortress

Wondrous item, rare

You can use an action to place this 1-inch metal cube on the ground and speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is empty.

The fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a [bonus action](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat/?uniqparam=OTVmZjAyMjA1Y2I2MzdjMjI5ZDZjZDRiYzY5NzNlYzM/#Bonus_Actions). It is immune to the [knock](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/knock) spell and similar magic, such as that of a chime of opening.

Each creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15 [Dexterity](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity) saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.

The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 [hit points](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points), immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and [resistance](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Damage-Resistance-and-Vulnerability) to all other damage. Only a [wish](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/wish) spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of [wish](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/wish) causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 [hit points](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points).

#### Ioun Stone

Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)

An Ioun stone is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of Ioun stone exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color.

When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful [attack](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack) roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 [Dexterity](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity) (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.

A stone has AC 24, 10 [hit points](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points), and [resistance](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Damage-Resistance-and-Vulnerability) to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.

Absorption (Very Rare): While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your [reaction](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reactions) to cancel a spell of 4th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you. Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't cancel it.

Agility (Very Rare): Your [Dexterity](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity) score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep red sphere orbits your head.

Awareness (Rare): You can't be surprised while this dark blue rhomboid orbits your head.

Fortitude (Very Rare): Your [Constitution](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Constitution) score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink rhomboid orbits your head.

Greater Absorption (Legendary): While this marbled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your [reaction](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reactions) to cancel a spell of 8th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you. Once the stone has canceled 50 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't cancel it.

Insight (Very Rare): Your [Wisdom](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom) score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue sphere orbits your head.

Intellect (Very Rare): Your [Intelligence](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence) score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled scarlet and blue sphere orbits your head.

Leadership (Very Rare): Your [Charisma](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Charisma) score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled pink and green sphere orbits your head.

Mastery (Legendary): Your proficiency bonus increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits your head.

Protection (Rare): You gain a +1 bonus to AC while this dusty rose prism orbits your head.

Regeneration (Legendary): You regain 15 [hit points](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head, provided that you have at least 1 hit point.

Reserve (Rare): This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 - 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM. Any creature can [cast a spell](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Cast-a-Spell) of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses. While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell [attack](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack) bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.

[Strength](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Strength) (Very Rare): Your [Strength](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Strength) score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head.

Sustenance (Rare): You don't need to eat or drink while this clear spindle orbits your head.

#### Iron Bands of Binding

Wondrous item, rare

This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can use an action to speak the command word and throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.

Make a [ranged attack](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Search) roll with an [attack](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack) bonus equal to your [Dexterity](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity) modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target is [restrained](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Restrained) until you take a [bonus action](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat/?uniqparam=OTVmZjAyMjA1Y2I2MzdjMjI5ZDZjZDRiYzY5NzNlYzM/#Bonus_Actions) to speak the command word again to release it. Doing so, or missing with the [attack](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack), causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.

A creature, including the one [restrained](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Restrained), can use an action to make a DC 20 [Strength](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Strength) check to break the iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed, and the [restrained](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Restrained) creature is freed. If the check fails, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.

Once the bands are used, they can't be used again until the next dawn.

#### Iron Flask

Wondrous item, legendary

This iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an action to speak the flask's command word, targeting a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you're on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 [Wisdom](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom) saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink and doesn't age.

You can use an action to remove the flask's stopper and release the creature the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that duration. If you give no commands or give it a command that is likely to result in its death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no [actions](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Actions-in-Combat). At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.

An [identify](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/identify) spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered bottle might already contain a creature chosen by the GM or determined randomly.

#### Lantern of Revealing

Wondrous item, uncommon

While lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible as long as they are in the lantern's bright light. You can use an action to lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5- foot radius.

#### Mantle of Spell Resistance

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

You have advantage on saving throws against spells while you wear this cloak.

#### Manual of Bodily Health

Wondrous item, very rare

This book contains health and diet tips, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's contents and practicing its guidelines, your [Constitution](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Constitution) score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.

#### Manual of Gainful Exercise

Wondrous item, very rare

This book describes fitness exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's contents and practicing its guidelines, your [Strength](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Strength) score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.

#### Manual of Golems

Wondrous item, very rare

This tome contains information and incantations necessary to make a particular type of golem. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly. To decipher and use the manual, you must be a spellcaster with at least two 5th-level spell slots. A creature that can't use a manual of golems and attempts to read it takes 6d6 psychic damage.

| d20 | Golem | Time | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1--5 | Clay | 30 days | 65,000 gp |
| 6--17 | Flesh | 60 days | 50,000 gp |
| 18 | Iron | 120 days | 100,000 gp |
| 19--20 | Stone | 90 days | 80,000 gp |

To create a golem, you must spend the time shown on the table, working without interruption with the manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours per day. You must also pay the specified cost to purchase supplies.

Once you finish creating the golem, the book is consumed in eldritch flames. The golem becomes animate when the ashes of the manual are sprinkled on it. It is under your control, and it understands and obeys your spoken commands.

#### Manual of Quickness of Action

Wondrous item, very rare

This book contains coordination and balance exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's contents and practicing its guidelines, your [Dexterity](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity) score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.

#### Marvelous Pigments

Wondrous item, very rare

Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.

Each pot of paint is sufficient to [cover](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Cover) 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features---such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons--- that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to [cover](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Cover) 100 square feet.

When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.

Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.

If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.

#### Medallion of Thoughts

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

The medallion has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the [detect thoughts](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/detect-thoughts) spell (save DC 13) from it. The medallion regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

#### Mirror of Life Trapping

Wondrous item, very rare

When this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 [hit points](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points), and [vulnerability](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Damage-Resistance-and-Vulnerability) to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to [0 hit points](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Dropping-to-0-Hit-Points).

If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word again.

Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 [Charisma](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Charisma) saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror's nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically.

An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't need to eat, drink, or [sleep](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/sleep). A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.

If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.

While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror's surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally.

In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.

#### Necklace of Adaptation

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

While wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have advantage on saving throws made against harmful gases and vapors (such as [cloudkill](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/cloudkill) and [stinking cloud](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/stinking-cloud) effects, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).

#### Necklace of Fireballs

Wondrous item, rare

This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level [fireball](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/fireball) spell (save DC 15).

You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the [fireball](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/fireball) by 1 for each bead beyond the first.

#### Necklace of Prayer Beads

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a [cleric](https://www.5esrd.com/classes/cleric), [druid](https://www.5esrd.com/classes/druid), or [paladin](https://www.5esrd.com/classes/paladin))

This necklace has 1d4 + 2 magic beads made from aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber, bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead loses its magic.

| d20 | Bead of | Spell |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1--6 | Blessing | [Bless](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/bless) |
| 7--12 | Curing | [Cure wounds](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/cure-wounds) (2nd level) or [lesser restoration](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/lesser-restoration) |
| 13--16 | Favor | [Greater restoration](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/greater-restoration) |
| 17--18 | Smiting | Branding smite |
| 19 | Summons | [Planar ally](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/planar-ally) |
| 20 | Wind | [Wind walk](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/wind-walk) |

Six types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the type of each bead on the necklace or determines it randomly. A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a [bonus action](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat/?uniqparam=OTVmZjAyMjA1Y2I2MzdjMjI5ZDZjZDRiYzY5NzNlYzM/#Bonus_Actions) (using your spell save DC if a save is necessary). Once a magic bead's spell is cast, that bead can't be used again until the next dawn.

#### Pearl of Power

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)

While this pearl is on your person, you can use an action to speak its command word and regain one expended spell slot. If the expended slot was of 4th level or higher, the new slot is 3rd level. Once you use the pearl, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

#### Periapt of Health

Wondrous item, uncommon

You are immune to contracting any disease while you wear this pendant. If you are already infected with a disease, the effects of the disease are suppressed you while you wear the pendant.

#### Periapt of Proof against Poison

Wondrous item, rare

This delicate silver chain has a brilliant-cut black gem pendant. While you wear it, poisons have no effect on you. You are immune to the [poisoned](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Poisoned) condition and have immunity to poison damage.

#### Periapt of Wound Closure

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

While you wear this pendant, you stabilize whenever you are dying at the start of [your turn](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Your-Turn). In addition, whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain [hit points](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points), double the number of [hit points](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) it restores.

#### Pipes of Haunting

Wondrous item, uncommon

You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. They have 3 charges. You can use an action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 [Wisdom](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom) saving throw or become [frightened](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Frightened) of you for 1 minute. If you [wish](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/wish), all creatures in the area that aren't hostile toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat it at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

#### Pipes of the Sewers

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. While you are attuned to the pipes, ordinary rats and giant rats are indifferent toward you and will not [attack](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack) you unless you threaten or harm them.

The pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as an action, you can use a [bonus action](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat/?uniqparam=OTVmZjAyMjA1Y2I2MzdjMjI5ZDZjZDRiYzY5NzNlYzM/#Bonus_Actions) to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one swarm of rats with each expended charge, provided that enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the GM). If there aren't enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren't under your control otherwise. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

Whenever a swarm of rats that isn't under another creature's control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, you can make a [Charisma](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Charisma) check contested by the swarm's [Wisdom](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom) check. If you lose the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed by the pipes' music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no [actions](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Actions-in-Combat). If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can't hear the pipes' music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours.

#### Portable Hole

Wondrous item, rare

This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.

You can use an action to unfold a portable hole and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the portable hole creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can't be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open portable hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it.

You can use an action to close a portable hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.

If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 [Strength](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Strength) check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the portable hole or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed portable hole can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.

Placing a portable hole inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, handy haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a [gate](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/gate) to the Astral Plane. The [gate](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/gate) originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the [gate](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/gate) is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The [gate](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/gate) then closes. The [gate](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/gate) is one-way only and can't be reopened.

#### Rope of Climbing

Wondrous item, uncommon

This 60-foot length of silk rope weighs 3 pounds and can hold up to 3,000 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak the command word, the rope animates. As a [bonus action](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat/?uniqparam=OTVmZjAyMjA1Y2I2MzdjMjI5ZDZjZDRiYzY5NzNlYzM/#Bonus_Actions), you can command the other end to move toward a destination you choose. That end moves 10 feet on [your turn](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Your-Turn) when you first command it and 10 feet on each of your turns until reaching its destination, up to its maximum length away, or until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.

If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1- foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants advantage on checks made to climb it.

The rope has AC 20 and 20 [hit points](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points). It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to [0 hit points](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Dropping-to-0-Hit-Points), it is destroyed.

#### Rope of Entanglement

Wondrous item, rare

This rope is 30 feet long and weighs 3 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak its command word, the other end darts forward to [entangle](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/entangle) a creature you can see within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 [Dexterity](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity) saving throw or become [restrained](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Restrained).

You can release the creature by using a [bonus action](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat/?uniqparam=OTVmZjAyMjA1Y2I2MzdjMjI5ZDZjZDRiYzY5NzNlYzM/#Bonus_Actions) to speak a second command word. A target [restrained](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Restrained) by the rope can use an action to make a DC 15 [Strength](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Strength) or [Dexterity](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity) check (target's choice). On a success, the creature is no longer [restrained](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Restrained) by the rope.

The rope has AC 20 and 20 [hit points](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points). It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to [0 hit points](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Dropping-to-0-Hit-Points), it is destroyed.

#### Scarab of Protection

Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)

If you hold this beetle-shaped medallion in your hand for 1 round, an inscription appears on its surface revealing its magical nature. It provides two benefits while it is on your person:

-   You have advantage on saving throws against spells.
-   The scarab has 12 charges. If you fail a saving throw against a necromancy spell or a harmful effect originating from an undead creature, you can use your [reaction](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reactions) to expend 1 charge and turn the failed save into a successful one. The scarab crumbles into powder and is destroyed when its last charge is expended.

#### Slippers of Spider Climbing

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

While you wear these light shoes, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. However, the slippers don't allow you to move this way on a slippery surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.

#### Sovereign Glue

Wondrous item, legendary

This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with oil of slipperiness. When found, a container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.

One ounce of the glue can [cover](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Cover) a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of universal solvent or oil of [etherealness](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/etherealness), or with a [wish](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/wish) spell.

#### Spell Scroll

Scroll, varies

A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class's spell list, you can use an action to read the scroll and cast its spell without having to provide any of the spell's components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible.

If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.

Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.

The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell's saving throw DC and [attack](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack) bonus, as well as the scroll's rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.

Spell Scroll

| Spell Level | Rarity | Save DC | [Attack](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack) Bonus |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cantrip | Common | 13 | +5 |
| 1st | Common | 13 | +5 |
| 2nd | Uncommon | 13 | +5 |
| 3rd | Uncommon | 15 | +7 |
| 4th | Rare | 15 | +7 |
| 5th | Rare | 17 | +9 |
| 6th | Very rare | 17 | +9 |
| 7th | Very rare | 18 | +10 |
| 8th | Very rare | 18 | +10 |
| 9th | Legendary | 19 | +11 |

A [wizard](https://www.5esrd.com/classes/wizard) spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a spell scroll, the copier must succeed on an [Intelligence](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence) (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.

#### Sphere of Annihilation

Wondrous item, legendary

This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.

The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to damage from a sphere of annihilation, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage.

The sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC 25 [Intelligence](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence) (Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 × your [Intelligence](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence) modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 13 [Dexterity](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity) saving throw or be touched by it, taking 4d10 force damage.

If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature's control, you make an [Intelligence](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence) (Arcana) check contested by the other creature's [Intelligence](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence) (Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains control of the sphere and can [levitate](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/levitate) it as normal.

If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that created by the [gate](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/gate) spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within a portable hole, the GM determines randomly what happens, using the following table.

| d100 | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 01--50 | The sphere is destroyed. |
| 51--85 | The sphere moves through the portal or into the extradimensional space. |
| 86--00 | A spatial rift sends each creature and object within 180 feet of the sphere, including the sphere, to a random plane of existence. |

#### Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals

Wondrous item, rare

If the stone is touching the ground, you can use an action to speak its command word and summon an earth elemental, as if you had cast the [conjure elemental](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/conjur-elemental) spell. The stone can't be used this way again until the next dawn. The stone weighs 5 pounds.

If you are a good [cleric](https://www.5esrd.com/classes/cleric) or [paladin](https://www.5esrd.com/classes/paladin), you can use the talisman as a holy [symbol](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/symbol), and you gain a +2 bonus to spell [attack](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack) rolls while you wear or hold it.

The talisman has 7 charges. If you are wearing or holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge from it and choose one creature you can see on the ground within 120 feet of you. If the target is of evil alignment, a flaming fissure opens under it. The target must succeed on a DC 20 [Dexterity](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity) saving throw or fall into the fissure and be destroyed, leaving no remains. The fissure then closes, leaving no trace of its existence. When you expend the last charge, the talisman disperses into motes of golden light and is destroyed.

A good creature takes 8d6 necrotic damage upon touching the talisman. Either sort of creature takes the damage again each time it ends its turn holding or carrying the talisman.

If you are an evil [cleric](https://www.5esrd.com/classes/cleric) or [paladin](https://www.5esrd.com/classes/paladin), you can use the talisman as a holy [symbol](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/symbol), and you gain a +2 bonus to spell [attack](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack) rolls while you wear or hold it.

Wondrous item, legendary

This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.

You can use an action to unfold and place the well of many worlds on a solid surface, whereupon it creates a two-way portal to another world or plane of existence. Each time the item opens a portal, the GM decides where it leads. You can use an action to close an open portal by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Once well of many worlds has opened a portal, it can't do so again for 1d8 hours.

#### Wind Fan

While holding this fan, you can use an action to cast the [gust of wind](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/gust-of-wind) spell (save DC 13) from it. Once used, the fan shouldn't be used again until the next dawn. Each time it is used again before then, it has a cumulative 20 percent chance of not working and tearing into useless, nonmagical tatters.

#### Winged Boots

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

While you wear these boots, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can use the boots to [fly](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/fly) for up to 4 hours, all at once or in several shorter flights, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration.
